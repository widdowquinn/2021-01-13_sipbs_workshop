    "This repository contains files for a 1hr bioinformatics workshop at the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/strathclydeinstituteofpharmacybiomedicalsciences/\">SIPBS</a> Research Day.\n",

    "The workshop is delivered by Dr Leighton Pritchard, covering queries to the [`UniProt`](https://www.uniprot.org/) database, as a worked example of how public bioinformatics resources can be mined readily and reproducibly using powerful open source tools, in support of your own research.\n",

    "## Who is this workshop for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is for anyone who is \"bioinformatics-curious,\" whether they already do some or all of their own bioinformatics, or are wondering what bioinformatics involves on a practical level. <font color='cornflowerblue'>If you are…</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*a complete novice*</font>: then you might learn about the scope and utility of the `UniProt` database, and see examples of how it can be queried in advanced ways - manually and computationally - to get the information you might need\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*already somewhat familiar with manually searching remote databases*</font>: then you might pick up some new things about `UniProt`, and how to automate this, making your research a little easier\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*familiar with Python*</font>: then you might find out how a new library, like [`bioservices`](https://bioservices.readthedocs.io/en/master/), could be of help to you in your own research\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understand the scope and structure of the [`UniProt`](https://www.uniprot.org/) database\n",
    "  - <font color='darkolivegreen'><b>Select the appropriate database and dataset for your research question</b></font>\n",
    "- Develop practical skills for advanced querying of `UniProt`\n",
    "  - <font color='darkolivegreen'><b>Compose targeted queries to make your data mining easier and more effective</b></font>\n",
    "- Understand how programming languages such as `Python` enable automated, large-scale data mining from public data repositories\n",
    "  - <font color='darkolivegreen'><b>Design and construct short code snippets that automate remote database queries</b></font>\n",
    "- Develop practical skills in `Python` to automate queries to remote databases\n",
    "  - <font color='darkolivegreen'><b>Classify results and compute summary statistics relevant to research questions</b></font>"
