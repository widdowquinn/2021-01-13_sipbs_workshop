    "\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*a complete novice*</font>: then you might learn about the scope and utility of the `UniProt` database, and see examples of how it can be queried in advanced ways - manually and computationally - to get the information you might need\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*already somewhat familiar with manually searching remote databases*</font>: then you might pick up some new things about `UniProt`, and how to automate this, making your research a little easier\n",
    "- <font color='cornflowerblue'>*familiar with Python*</font>: then you might find out how a new library, like [`bioservices`](https://bioservices.readthedocs.io/en/master/), could be of help to you in your own research\n",

    "- Understand how programming languages such as `Python` enable automated, large-scale data mining from public data repositories\n",
    "  - <font color='darkolivegreen'><b>Design and construct short code snippets that automate remote database queries</b></font>\n",
    "- Develop practical skills in `Python` to automate queries to remote databases\n",
